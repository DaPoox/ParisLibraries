# ParisLibraries
A similar approach to the database architecture for libraries in the city of Paris.
This was a small school project, where we had to create a similar database architecture for some libraries in the city of Paris.
The approach was simple: One database shared between the set of the libraries. 
The main steps:
- Imagine the main structure of the databse (Model.pdf).
- Create the tables.
- Populate the tables with data samples.
- Create the necessary triggers and functions (Trying to imagine all the possible scenarios).
- Create some test scripts where we try to run the scenarios possible and analyse the results.
The project rapport was written in french. I'll do my best to upload an english version of it.
